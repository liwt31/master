abstract="Organic cocrystals that are composed of two or more components usually exhibit novel, unpredictable, and even unique properties rather than a simple combination of the properties of their components, such as white-light emission, ambipolar charge transport, nonlinear optics, and ferroelectricity. Since cocrystal engineering represents a novel strategy for synthesizing multifunctional materials, which opens the door for molecular collaborative innovation, it has aroused much attention in recent years. However, as it is also a relatively new research field, it is only in its early stages of development. In order to provide readers with an understanding of the future design of cocrystals for potential applications, a brief review of organic cocrystals is presented here, including an introduction to organic cocrystals as well as discussions of cocrystal preparation, methods and techniques of characterization, and multifunctional applications of cocrystals. Moreover, the outlook for further studies and applications of cocrystal engineering is considered.",

The iterative partial linearized density matrix path-integral propagation approach, which involves both forward and backward propagation of electronic degrees of freedom together with a linearized, short-time approximation for the nuclear degrees of freedom, provides an accurate and efficient way to model the nonadiabatic quantum dynamics at the heart of these EET processes. Combined with a recently developed chromophore–protein interaction model that incorporates both accurate ab initio descriptions of intracomplex vibrations and chromophore–protein interactions treated with atomistic detail, these simulation tools are beginning to unravel the detailed EET pathways and relaxation dynamics in light harvesting complexes. }

It is the general linear, Markovian, form which ensures that the density matrix is Hermitian, trace 1, positive and completely positive. Some elementary examples of the Lindblad equation are given. The derivation of the Lindblad equation presented here is ‘simple’ in that all it uses is the expression of a Hermitian matrix in terms of its orthonormal eigenvectors and real eigenvalues. Thus, it is appropriate for students who have learned the algebra of quantum theory. Where helpful, arguments are first given in a two-dimensional Hilbert space.}

abstract = "We use the graphical processing unit (GPU) to accelerate the tensor contractions, which is the most time consuming operations in the variational method based on the plaquette renormalized states. Using a frustrated Heisenberg J1–J2 model on a square lattice as an example, we implement the algorithm based on the compute unified device architecture (CUDA). For a single plaquette contraction with the bond dimensions C=3 of each rank of the tensor, results are obtained 25 times faster on GPU than on a current CPU core. This makes it possible to simulate systems with the size 8×8 and larger, which are extremely time consuming on a single CPU. This technology successfully relieves the computing time dependence with C, while in the CPU serial computation, the total required time scales both with C and the system size."

abstract = "In the numerical analysis of strongly correlated quantum lattice models one of the leading algorithms developed to balance the size of the effective Hilbert space and the accuracy of the simulation is the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm, in which the run-time is dominated by the iterative diagonalization of the Hamilton operator. As the most time-dominant step of the diagonalization can be expressed as a list of dense matrix operations, the DMRG is an appealing candidate to fully utilize the computing power residing in novel kilo-processor architectures. In the paper a smart hybrid CPU–GPU implementation is presented, which exploits the power of both CPU and GPU and tolerates problems exceeding the GPU memory size. Furthermore, a new CUDA kernel has been designed for asymmetric matrix–vector multiplication to accelerate the rest of the diagonalization. Besides the evaluation of the GPU implementation, the practical limits of an FPGA implementation are also discussed."
